# git status 

The commmand `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commit need to pushed/pulled, etc. It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check.

It's a command that is safe to use at any time. if you want to see what is going on it's good to use `git status` inbetween commands until you get to know the flow better.
```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "MOdified landing page"
git status

git push
git status 
```
